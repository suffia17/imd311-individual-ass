<p style="text-align: center;"">My family consists of 7 members, namely father, umi and me who are the number 2 child out of 5 siblings.
     In this family, of course I really admire my mom and dad because they were never divided giving enough love for the five of us. 
     They always give the best for their children. That is why our family is so close. We always shared our feelings, expressed our problems with each other and my parents who gave us a lot of encouragement and advice.
